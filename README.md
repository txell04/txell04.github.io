PROJECT ANALYSIS
User profile: 
The final user of my website would be someone interested in hiring me, likely a hiring manager or a person who works in the human resources department. They would expect to find information about whether I am currently studying or employed, what studies I have finished, relevant skills, any experience I have in their field, and any internships I've done. 


Information architecture: 
The information architecture of this project has a simple and clear structure, distributed on the single page the web has. This page has been divided into sections to make it easier for the final user to find what they are searching for. In total, we could find up to six different sections, including the header and the footer, which contains the contact information. The structure of every section is the following: 

- Header: The first thing every user sees when they enter the web, it includes my name and my career with an image to ensure the design it's simple but not plain.

- Education: This first section includes all the relevant information about my educational history, starting with the most recent; allowing the reader to quickly identify my level of education and what I'm coursing at the moment.

- Technical Skills: This section presents my technical skills grouped by type (programming languages, development tools, databases and operating systems). Its purpose it's to show the qualities I have in an ordered way and without taking too much space.

- Work Experience: Containing a big part of the information I want to show with my web, this section is organized in an accordion format for a much simpler first look. When expanded, a small description of the tasks I had shows, making it simple for the user to find what they are looking for.

- Languages: Along with the final part, this section shows the languages ​​I know and my level in each.

- Contact (Contact): The final section contains my contact details, making it easy for anyone to connect with me.


Visual design: 
The visual aspect of this project has been decided following a professional and simple aesthetic with a personal touch; meaning that color had to make an appearance. However, the color palette used has been simple and soft: basic black and white, and shades of blue and orange to go with it. Among these last two, the protagonist is blue, which gives a professional look and combines perfectly with the photograph at the beginning. To complement this color, orange is a simple option that does not go out of tune when combined properly and is a great alternative when used in a darker tone, being brown. The white background is always a great start, and combining it with light blue helps the user distinguish the sections.
Now for the typography, I chose “Allerta”, a modern sans-serif font that has good readability and keeps the page simple. All the text is in this typography except for the caption under my name on the first section, where I chose "Space Mono", a monospaced font, to make a small change that goes along with the text.
The page layout it's as simple as the color palette and the typographies used, one area at a time. Following what I said previously, the background colors are used to make a difference between sections, so the user is almost guided along the page.
