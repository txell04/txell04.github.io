PROJECT ANALYSIS
User profile: 
The final user of my website would be someone interested in hiring me, likely a hiring manager or a person who works in the human resources department. They would expect to find 
information about whether I am currently studing or employed, what studies I have finished, relevant skills, any experience I have in their field, and any internships I've done. 


Information architecture: describe using around 200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the information of the page. in this project, 
which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis is basically the distribution of the different sections of the CV on the page

Visual design: describe using around 200 words (minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.
which color palette will you use? Which typography? Which page layout? Look for inspirational similar projects

////////////////////////////
1 Project Goals
In this project, you will have to design and develop a website to show your Curriculum
Vitae. This website has to show your skills and experience (as a typical CV) but can
also include your portfolio (links to projects that you have been involved in).
-- In this project I will show my experience and skills but I don't really have any projects so I don't think I'll put any of that.
The project will have the following steps:
• Project analysis:
• Design proposal using Figma
• Project implementation


2 Documentation
The final submission will consist of a link to a GitHub repository with:
• README.md file with the following information:
    o Project analysis, User profile: create a user persona for your website
    o Project analysis, Information architecture: describe using around
    200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the information of
    the page.
    o Project analysis, Visual design: describe using around 200 words
    (minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.
    o Link to the Figma project.
• Website code (at least HTML and CSS files)
• Create a public link to your page (you can use, for instance, GitHub pages)


3 General considerations:
• Remember, this project must be developed individually.
• This project is assumed to be a single-page static website, but if you prefer
to do multiple pages or add some degree of interaction is ok. It is also
assumed to work on desktop screens, but being web responsive will be a
plus.
• You can use other tools such as Bootstrap or other frameworks. Mention it
on the README.me file and justify why you have used them.
• Try to be creative in your proposal.
• Code clarity and correctness will be evaluated.
